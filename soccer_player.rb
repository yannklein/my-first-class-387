# Imagine we want to build a soccer video game.
# Just like you would begin by creating the Soccer players
# in a soccer board game, we will start building our digital players

# 1. Let's begin with the mould (= the class)
#   - create a SoccerPlayer class
#   - the car should have:
#        a name (defined at the player creation),
#        a club (defined at the player creation),
#        a monthly salary (defined at the player creation),
#        whether he/she got a red card or not (initially not!)

#   - we should be able to get his/her name, monthly salary, red card status
#   - we should be able to get the player's club and change it
#   - we should be able to give a red card to a player

# 2. Now, let's make our player models (= instances)
#   - build two Car instances
#   - change the first player club
#   - give a red card to the second!
